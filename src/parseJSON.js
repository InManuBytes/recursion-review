// this is what you would do if you were one to do things the easy way:
// var parseJSON = JSON.parse;

// but you're not, so you'll write it from scratch:
var parseJSON = function(json) {
  // your code goes here
  //if json is unparsable then throw syntax error
  for(let i =1; i< json.length;i++)

  let arrayExp = /^\'\[/;
  //test if array or objects with regular expressions
  //not all double quotes need to be removed
  '{"foo": "bar"}' -> obj =   {foo: "bar"}
